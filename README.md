Below are some resources I found useful when starting to learn React and how to use it with Django.

* I started by doing this course to understand React: https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/ then built some of my own functionality using that as a base and https://facebook.github.io/react/ as a reference.

* Starting point for Django Rest Framework was: http://www.django-rest-framework.org

* Return results from multiple models with Django REST Framework: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18702300/return-results-from-multiple-models-with-django-rest-framework

* Getting webpack working with Django: http://geezhawk.github.io/using-react-with-django-rest-framework

* Found this useful when trying to set up a multi page app: http://gregblogs.com/how-django-reactjs-and-browserify/
